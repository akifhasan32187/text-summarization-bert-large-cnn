# CSE495-Text-Summarization-Using-BERT
Text summarization is the process of generating a concise and coherent summary of a given text while preserving its vital information and main ideas.

This project was a part of my undergraduate course, CSE 495: Special Topics (Natural Language Processing). Our project focused on text summarization using the BART Large-CNN model. We utilized the CORD-19 research challenge dataset, which contains a vast collection of research papers. By training the BART Large-CNN model on this dataset, we developed a system capable of generating concise and coherent summaries of research papers. To evaluate the quality of our summaries, we used BLEU and ROUGE scores, which measure the similarity between the generated summaries and the actual abstracts of the papers. Through this project, we showcased our proficiency in text summarization, leveraging advanced models, and evaluating performance. The project has implications for researchers seeking efficient ways to extract key information from research papers.
